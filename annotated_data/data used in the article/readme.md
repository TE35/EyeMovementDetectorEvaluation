# Labelled data used the study
This folder contains only the subset of the data used in the Andersson et al algorithm comparison study. Use this if you want to replicate the results.

If you want the best possible labelled input to your own algo, then don't forget to grab the corrected file in the "fix_by_Zemblys2018" folder.
