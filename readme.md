# Eye Movement Detector Evaluation
Contains the annotation tool, used stimuli, and data labelled by two annotators. Code and data are in Matlab formats. Analysis code is not entirely complete as it was done interactively do an extent, but should give a good clue to what was done.

This was the data used in:
